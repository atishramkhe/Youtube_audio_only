# YouTube Audio Only

A Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey/Greasemonkey userscript that enables an audio-only mode on YouTube. This script hides the video playback while keeping the audio running seamlessly, with a perfectly aligned toggle button in the YouTube player controls.

## Features
- **Audio-Only Mode**: Hides the video element while keeping the audio playing.
- **Toggle Button**: Adds a clean, perfectly aligned "Audio" button to YouTube's player controls for easy switching between audio-only and video modes.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with YouTube's single-page application (SPA) navigation.
- **Customizable UI**: Includes hover effects and a polished design for the toggle button.

> **Note**: Bandwidth reduction by forcing minimal video quality is not functional yet but will be included in the next update.
